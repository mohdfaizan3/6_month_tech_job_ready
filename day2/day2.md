>   After setting basic environment, getting yourself declutter. Because we want the best environment with least clutter that will lead you for better output, and prepare for deepwork and eventually land your dream job

1. Declutter youtube.

    The people you follow on youtube and watch their videos determine who are you and where you end up. So manage your sight by eliminating the youtube cringe by
    - [ ] 'Not Interested' for unnecessary youtube feed.
    - [ ] Unsubscribing the channels which add no value in your life.
    - [ ] Or keeping a seperate account for programming and learning purpose.
    - [ ] Subscribe channels related to your field.
        - Fireship

        - free code camp
        - etc...
    1. If you use youtube in your pc then use this [extention](https://unhook.app/) to save your time on youtube
        * Add extension and remove all the unused and distracting features and keep youtube distration free.
        
    2. If you use youtube in your mobile then use this steps to deactivate shorts and reels.
            * Then I highly recommend [Onesec](https://one-sec.app/)

2. Declutter social media
    Social media is a gift along with curse of elimination of our attention, hence getting out of unhealthy socials(snapchat, instagram, unimportant whatsapp groups, facebook feed, or other media you use) is great choice.
    
    - delete it or minimize it.
    - Use them in desktop with extentions to avoid clutter.

3. Create a quiet, comfortable space: 
    Find a quiet and comfortable place where you can work without interruption. This might be a designated workspace, a coffee shop, or a library.

4. Remove physical distractions: 
        Clear your workspace of any physical distractions, such as clutter or unnecessary items. This can help you focus more easily on your work.

5. Use a productivity tool:
       Consider using a productivity tool such as a Pomodoro timer or an app that blocks distracting websites. These tools can help you stay on task and avoid distractions.
       
       
Congratulation ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠ.
